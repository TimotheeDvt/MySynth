# MySynth

A minimal JUCE-based synthesizer project.

## Overview
MySynth is a small synth application built with the JUCE framework. Intended as a starting point for learning JUCE audio programming and building a simple polyphonic synthesizer.

Built following these incredible tutorials :

In the future I aim to build a microtonal VST from this basic synth.
